# Virtual_Keyboard
This project leverages OpenCV and MediaPipe for real-time hand tracking to create a touch-free typing experience. By hovering a fingertip over virtual buttons on the screen, the system detects interaction and types the corresponding key into Notepad, offering a seamless blend of computer vision and interactivity.
